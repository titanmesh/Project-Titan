Hi there, 
If your not sure whats happening let me explain... 

How it all started,
I (Daniel Everitt) is a post graduate from Sheffield Hallam University sudying Network Design and Managment. Whilst studying here I have always had an interest in networking (Hard Wired & Wireless) and whilst talking with a group of friends it was brought up about creating a ecentralised network around our home town of Worksop. This is a holding group for that idea. 

How can you join?
We are in the very early stages at the moment and dont actually have any nodes active as of yet. I am simply looking if there would be any interest in this. 
If you were interested sign up! 

To get connected to the Titan Mesh, you would need line of sight from your room to a node. The first node will be within the Bracebridge area. If you are not within range at the moment, dont worry! We are hoping to be expanding real soon!

For any more information get in touch through our email. 

Till the next update. 

Dan
