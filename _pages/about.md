About Project Titan 
The Titan Mesh Project is a community-owned project offering fast and free internet solely ran by volunteers. By connecting to the Titan mesh project, you could help drive and spread the reach further afield by solely just having a connection on your rooftop. This helps you and your nearby neighbours to get a safer, cheaper and net neutral internet connection! 

A Titan Mesh connection be can be used alongside your current connection to the main internet as a backup, or you could simply switch over to us completely as your primary means of internet connectivity. 

We are a non-profit project, this means all the money donated / contributed to us goes straight back in to making the project better over time. Titan Mesh is solely ran from donations and sponsorships of people that wish to help. 

Did you know TITAN is also an acronym from: The Internet Thatâ€™s always neutral? 

This means that at no point will we collect any data from you, block any content from you or restrict you from using the network/internet how you want.
