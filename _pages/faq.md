How does this work? 
We place an antenna on the side of your house / building this is then connected down to a Wireless Access point in your home in the best available space for the whole house to enjoy our services. 

Who can access this project? 
Currently we only have master node set up in the Kilton area of Worksop, anyone with line of sight to this master node can join! 

How fast is it? 
This all depends on a range of attributes (interference, weather and range from our master node), but we aim to supply 20 mbps, if we can get more we will give more. 

Will you expand to more areas? 
When Titan get more widely known and we have more requests, we will get more master nodes around the town, this all comes at cost though and we can only do this if the funds permit. 

What’s the end goal for project titan? 
Try and reach as many end users as we can with our ethics of providing a open and neutral internet for everyone interested with the freedom from the main UK ISP’s3
